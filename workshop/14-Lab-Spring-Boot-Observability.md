# 14. Lab - Spring Boot Observability

## Goal(s)

An important step before going to production is to know how you plan to monitor and manage the Producer and Consumer
applications themselves. Spring Boot has good support with tools like Micrometer and Sleuth to expose both metrics and
traces, but we need a place to send them.  This lab will introduce the free Wavefront option that you can use to explore
the metrics.

## Follow These Steps
