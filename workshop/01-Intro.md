# Apace Kafka + Spring Boot Workshop

## Overview

The goal of this workshop is to provide an overview of the Kafka architecture, fundamental concepts and basic
architecture patterns and use cases for Kafka.

Additionally, we will introduce Spring Boot and the Spring Kafka libraries and demonstrate their use over several
progressive labs demonstrating the practices of producing, consuming and streaming events to and from Kafka.

## What is Apache Kafka?

Apache Kafka is a distributed data store optimized for ingesting and processing streaming data in real-time. Streaming
data is data that is continuously generated by thousands of data sources, which typically send the data records in
simultaneously. A streaming platform needs to handle this constant influx of data, and process the data sequentially and
incrementally.

Kafka provides three main functions to its users:

* Publish and subscribe to streams of records
* Effectively store streams of records in the order in which records were generated
* Process streams of records in real time

Kafka is primarily used to build real-time streaming data pipelines and applications that adapt to the data streams. It
combines messaging, storage, and stream processing to allow storage and analysis of both historical and real-time data.
